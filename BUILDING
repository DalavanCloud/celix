To build:

cd build
## Run cmake and select the subprojects to be build
## For commandline use "ccmake ..", for a GUI use "cmake-gui"
## After running a first configure the subproject can be found by looking for "BUILD_{NAME}" options.
## After selection a new configure and generation is needed
##
## Note: Running a simple "cmake .." will only generate build files for the framework and utils. 
ccmake .. 

## Make builds all bundles, but deploys nothing
make

## Deploying takes care of copying bundles to a target for testing
make deploy
